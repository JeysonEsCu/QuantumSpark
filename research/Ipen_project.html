      Size effect of MoO<sub>3</sub> on the production of <sup>99m</sup>Tc
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      <sup>99m</sup>Tc can be obtained through beta decay of <sup>99</sup>Mo,
      which is produced in a fission nuclear reactor when a neutron interacts
      with a <sup>98</sup>Mo nucleus, converting it into <sup>99</sup>Mo, an
      instable beta emitting isotope.
      <br />
      The instability of <sup>98</sup>Mo is resolved when one neutron in the
      nucleus undergoes beta decay, transforming into a proton and emitting an
      electron which is expelled (known as a beta particle). This process
      increases the atomic number while keeping constant the number of nucleons,
      transforming into an instable Technetium isotope.
      <br />
      Due to the continuos energy spectrum of beta particles, two important
      isotopes are produced, <sup>99</sup>Tc and <sup>99m</sup>Tc with a
      half-life of 2.111 x 10<sup>5</sup> years and 6 hours respectively. The
      latter isotope is widely used in nuclear medicine and the focus of the
      project.
      <br />
      The first steps was taking the same MoO<sub>3</sub> powder used in the
      radioisotope production plant (PPR) at the Peruvian Nuclear Energy
      Institute (IPEN) and characterize it using sieves of different sizes to
      create a size distribution histogram. Since this process is does not cover
      a wide range of particle sizes, the next step involved was wet milling
      with ethanol as the liquid phase, applying different milling times to
      achieve a more uniform size distribution.
      <br />
      However, mechanical methods have limitations in the particle sizes they
      can produce. To cover a further size range, MoO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles
      were employed. All samples were characterized using scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM).
      <br />
      Some important considerations that had to be taken into account included
      the neutron flux at the irradiation position in the reactor and the energy
      range of neutrons interacting with the molybdenum target. To determine the
      neutron flux in irradiation position, flux monitors were used. These
      consisted of thin sheets with known purity: cupper (<sup>63</sup>Cu) and
      indium (<sup>115</sup>In) for epithermal neutron flux and gold
      (<sup>197</sup>Au) for thermal neutron flux, which were irradiated
      together inside the irradiation can (container where the target is
      placed).
      <br />
      After, the irradiation period, the samples were returned and stored in a
      lead box until the radiation level was low enough to be safely handled.
      Once safe, the samples were measured using a gamma spectrometer to
      determine the neutron flux in the two energy intervals at this power.
      Depending on the activity of the samples, the gamma spectrometer could be
      with either of the two hyper pure-Ge detector geometry (two-pi or
      four-pi).
      <br />
      Before sending the samples to the reactor, they had to be prepared for
      placement in the irradiation can. Two methods were used: the first was
      making "<strong>pills</strong>" with the powders of different sizes, which
      were then sealed in plastic bags, labeled and separated with aluminum
      foil. The second method used small PET containers, where the mass of
      MoO<sub>3</sub>
      powder was calculated by measuring the difference between the full
      container and the empty container.
      <br />
      Both techniques used to package the samples has to ensure that they
      remained in the same position into the container. This was achieved by
      using PET sponges at the top of the container to fill the empty space.
      After sealing the PET container, it was placed into another container
      named
      <strong>irradiation can</strong> and sealed. Before being sent to the
      reactor, the irradiation can had to pass a "<strong>leak test</strong>".
      <br />
      Once all tests were successfully completed, the irradiation container was
      sent to the reactor for a previously calculated time at the reactor's
      power the neutron flux monitor were irradiated. After the irradiation
      period, and a necessary decay period to reduce the radiation level, the
      samples were measured in a gamma spectrometer to determine the activity of
      the produced <sup>99m</sup>Tc. The preliminary results were reported and
      presented at the Iberoamerican congress of Chemsitry in 2018.
