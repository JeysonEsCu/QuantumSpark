      Kinetic study of the competition between CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
      binding to hemoglobin
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      This study was a part of a university project in the bachelor course
      "Research in chemistry A", started with the optimization of the O<sub
        >2</sub
      >
      and CO<sub>2</sub> and hemoglobin molecules. It was tested different level
      of theory to determine which could achieve convergence.
      <br />
      The software used was Gaussian 09 and the tested levels of theory tested
      included BLYP, PBE, B3LYP and M06, combined with the Pople's basis sets:
      3-21G, 6-31G, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d), 6-31+G(d,p) and 6-311G.
      <br />
      As my first project in computational chemistry, I focused on analyzed
      geometry, vibrational frequencies,and energies differences, comparing the
      results obtained from each method.
      <br />
      The outcomes reported here are result of a new set of calculation, now
      using the article
      <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jp5086203"
        >J. Phys. Chem. B 2015, 119, 4, 1275-1287</a
      >
      as a reference since the original results could not recovered.
      <br />
      The molecular geometries were optimized using the level of theory:
      UB3LYP/LANL2DZ for Fe and UB3LYP/6-31G* for the H, C, N and O. Since the
      molecule contains Fe(III), the charge and multiplicity used was (1, 2).
      However, the optimization of hemoglobin with Fe(II) was also performed.
