      Finding Transiting exoplanets in the Milky Way

      Planet Hunter TESS project

    <p class="text">
      The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope in
      NASA's Explorers program, designed to search for exoplanets using the
      transit method. This method involves analyzing a star's brightness and
      detecting periodic dimming caused by a planet passing in front of it.
      However, for this technique to work, the planetary system must be oriented
      so that the planet transits between the telescope and its host star. As a
      volunteer, I classified photometric transit data from 1,125 exoplanets,
      searching for new exoplanet candidates.
      <br />
      During this experience, I learned to detect a planet, or multiple planets,
      passing in front of a star and determine the orbital period by analyzing
      the periodicity, depth, and spacing of the dips in brightness. This
      allowed me to infer a planet's distance from its host star. Once I
      understood how a planetary transit appears in data, identifying an
      <strong>eclipsing binary</strong> as a result of binary systems, where two
      stars orbit around each other, became easier by paying attention to the
      shape of the curves.
