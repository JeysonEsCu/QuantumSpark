    <p class="text">
      The synthesis of Iron saccharine started eliminating the dissolved oxygen
      from water through a argon flux in a Schlenk line in at inner atmosphere
      of argon.. The iron saccharine is prepared from a saccharine that contains
      iron and sulphur with heat and stirring.
      <br />
      Next step is the filtration of the compound, I tested it at room
      temperature and in a cold bath. These two methods produces two different
      crystal sizes, the one at low temperature produces crystals fast but
      small, while the one at room took time but produced bigger ones.
      <br />
      Another method that I tested was using small crystals obtained in previous
      tests in the collection glass as nucleation centers, this method produced
      bigger crystals. The cross contamination in all the tested method had to
      be avoided. Any piece of impurity could work as a nucleation center!
      <br />
      Another technique used was the recrystallization, using a mixture of
      solvents with low evaporation temperature, the compound was dissolved and
      then cooled down to room temperature, producing a better crystal
      structures.
      <br />
      After getting the crystals, I analyze the fusion point, a short range of
      fusion temperature suggesting that the compound was pure. Otherwise, the
      long range of temperature would suggest that the compound was
      contaminated.
      <br />
      Another test done was the solubility using different solvents. The
      solvents tested were methanol, DMSO, DMF, ethanol, Chloroform, THF,
      acetone and methanol.
      <br />
      The most time demanding time and excited part as a first year student was
      testing different synthetical routes testing different conditions of
      temperature, vacuum, and time.
      <br />
      Theoretical studies are coming soon!
