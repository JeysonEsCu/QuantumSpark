      in 2020. The research started analyzing the Ru-PPh<sub>3</sub> bond
      dissociation bond to verify the existence of an intermediate which was not
      considered in the original study. This step, referred to as
      <strong>"catalyst activation"</strong>, suggested that this intermediate,
      <strong>Am</strong>, is energetically less stable than the catalyst, but
      still possible with the elimination of the PPh<sub>3</sub> being an
      endothermic process. The intermediate <strong>Am</strong> is necessary due
      to the presence of a region where the ethoxy group (from the ethanol used
      as a solvent) attaches to the Ru atom while the chlorine atom is leaving,
      following a <strong>S<sub>N</sub>2</strong> reaction. A scan calculate
      indicated the absence of a barrier for this process or a too small one to
      be accurately calculated. A <strong>S<sub>N</sub>1</strong> reaction was
      also tested, however the energy of the resulting intermediate was
      significantly higher than the <strong>Am</strong>.
      <br />
      The new intermediate, <strong>B</strong> is more stable than the first two
      intermediates and is formed through an endothermic process.
      <strong>B</strong> is the first intermediate in the first cycle that gives
      as a first product the (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene. The intermediate
      <strong>B</strong> undergoes a rearrangement, forming an Ru-H bond (taking
      the acidic proton from the ethoxy group). This process results in the
      intermediate <strong>C</strong> and the byproduct ethanal with a reaction
      barrier of 12.1 Kcal/mol in an exothermic step. This intermediate
      <strong>C</strong> plays a crucial rol in the formation of the final
      product, participating in the subsequent cycle to yield
      (E)-1,2-diphenylethene. The interaction between the intermediate
      <strong>C</strong> and the ethylene occurs without a energy barrier,
      leading in the intermediate <strong>D</strong>, where the ruthenium
      interacts with the triple bond, forming a is more stable intermediate,
      after overcoming an small barrier, a Ru-C bond is formed resulting in an
      even more stable intermediate, <strong>E</strong>.
      <br />
      Two additional intermediates were proposed to clarify the reaction
      mechanism. To complete the first cycle, the catalyst must eliminate the
      (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene group and incorporate the ethoxy group. The first
      missing intermediate involves be the coordination between intermediate
      <strong>E</strong> and the ethanol, <strong>Em</strong>, occurring without
      an barrier and increasing slightly the system's energy. The intermediate
      <strong>Em</strong> facilitates the migration of the proton from the
      ethanol to the C=C double bond, leading the formation of the bound between
      the catalyst the the ethoxy group, resulting in the intermediate
      <strong>Em2</strong>. This new intermediate regenerates the catalyst as
      intermediate <strong>B</strong> releasing the intermediate product of the
      overall reaction, with &Delta;G = - 23 Kcal/mol.
      <br />
      The second cycle start with the interaction of the product of the first
      cycle and the intermediate <strong>C</strong> forming a more stable
      intermediate, <strong>F</strong>. The process <strong>D</strong> &rarr;
      <strong>E</strong> is repeated, but using the (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene
      instead of the ethylene to form the intermediate <strong>G</strong>. In
      this intermediate, the double bond is replaced by a single bond, allowing
      free rotate to adopt the most favorable and stable conformation. Since
      the, ethane contains two phenyl substituent, the most energetically
      favorable conformer is the one where the phenyl group are positioned
      furthest apart. Once this conformer is established, one hydrogen migrates
      from the single bond to the ruthenium, following the reverse process
      <strong>G</strong> &rarr; <strong>F</strong>. This results in the
      formation of the final suggested intermediate, <strong>Gm</strong>, which
      regenerates the catalyst as the intermediate <strong>C</strong> and giving
      as the final product the (E)-1,2-diphenylethene.
      <br />
      It is important to note that the intermediate <strong>C</strong> has a
      region where various compounds can interact with it, including the
      ethanol, which acts as a hydrogen donor and solvent. Calculation suggested
      that the reaction between the intermediate <strong>C</strong> and the
      ethanol is feasible, occurring spontaneously and exothermically. This side
      reaction was useful to estimate the yield of the reaction, as the
      concentration of the intermediate <strong>C</strong> is crucial, given its
      role in both catalytic cycles. A topological analysis and microkinetic
      analysis were performed in the paper.
