      in 2020, the research started analyzing the breaking of the Ru-PPh<sub

      bond to verify the existence of an intermediate which was not considered
      in the original article. This step is named
      <strong>"the activation of the catalyst"</strong> and our calculation
      suggests that this intermediate, <strong>Am</strong>, is energetically
      less stable than the catalyst, but still possible. The intermediate
      <strong>Am</strong> is necessary due to the existence of a region where
      the ethoxy group is attached to the Ru atom while the chlorine atom is
      leaving, following a <strong>S<sub>N</sub>2</strong> reaction. The new
      intermediate, <strong>B</strong>, is the first intermediate in the first
      cycle that will give as a first product the (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene. This
      new intermediate suffers a rearrangement forming the Ru-H bond, giving the
      intermediate <strong>C</strong> and the subproduct ethanol. This
      intermediate also participates in the next cycle to produce the
      (E)-1,2-diphenylethene. The interaction between the intermediate
      <strong>C</strong> and the ethylene is a process that does not have a
      barrier and the resulting intermediate, <strong>D</strong>, the
      interaction of the Ruthenium with the triple bond of the ethylene drives
      the migration of the H from the catalyst to the ethylene, forming the
      intermediate <strong>E</strong>. The final step is the formation of the
      (E)-1,2-diphenylethene and the regeneration of the catalyst.
      <br />
      The product formed in the first cycle intects with the catalyst with the
      intermediate <strong>C</strong> to form an intermediate equivalent to
      intermediate <strong>D</strong> called intermediate <strong>F</strong>,
