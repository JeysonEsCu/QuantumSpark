    <h2 class="subtitle">About me</h2>
    <p class="text">
      I am Jeyson Esquivel Curichimba, currently (2024) a PhD student at
      Bergische Universität Wuppertal in Germany working under the supervision
      of Hilke Bahmann in the implementation of Locally Range Separation
      (<strong>LRS</strong>) exchange correlation functionals to study
      properties of systems in excited states in the program package
      <strong>TURBOMOLE</strong>.
      <br />
      However, my interest in research is not limited to this topic. I studied
      the bachelors in chemistry at the National University of San Marcos
      (<strong>UNMSM</strong>) in Peru, where I had the opportunity to work as a
      lab assistant in the
      <a href="/research/saccharine.html">synthesis of Iron saccharine</a> under
      the supervision of Christian Aliaga in my first year, funded by the Fund
      for Innovation, Science, and Technology (FINCyT) through project 364 PNICP
      PIBA 2014. In this project, I learned the basics of the synthesis of
      coordination compounds and the use of the Schlenk line.
      <br />
      During this year and the year after, I studied and got fascinated in the
      universe of math, starting with spacial analytical geometry, linear
      algebra, analysis and one of the most exciting topic, differential
      equations. During those two years, I also focus in understanding theses
      topics in deep.
      <br />
      The first course that I made me interested myself in Theoretical Chemistry
      was Electronic and Molecular Structure, where I learned the basics of
      quantum mechanics and its application in the study of the electronic
      structure of atoms and molecules and then Introduction in Quantum
      chemistry, that I studied simultaneously at UNMSM and in the Science
      department of the University of Engineering (<strong>UNI</strong>).
      <br />
      With my background in math and quantum chemistry, I started my first
      project studying
      <a href="/research/hemoglobin.html"
        >Kinetic study of the competition between the binding of CO<sub>2</sub>
        and O<sub>2</sub> to hemoglobin</a
      >
      using the software Gaussian, supervised by professor Dr. Cjuno. However,
      due to the complexity of the project, time and facilities limitations, I
      could not finished it, but I learned the basics of using the software and
      how to get and interpret results.
      <br />
      My next interest topic was Radiochemistry, where I learned about basic
      aspects of nuclear physics, radioactive processes, radioactive
      equilibrium, nuclear detectors, radiological protection, neutron
      activation analysis (NAA), nuclear fusion, radioisotopes production,
      nuclear reactors, application in chemistry and other areas, besides I took
      the lab course at the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy
      (<strong>IPEN</strong>), being able to use real radioactive materials and
      facilities to analyze radioisotopes. After a successful results in the
      course I applied for an internship in the same Institute to work in the
      project
      <a href="/research/Ipen_project.html"
        >Size effect of the MoO<sub>3</sub> in the Tc-99m production</a
      >
      founded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (<strong>IAEA</strong>)
      by the Coordinated Research Project No. F22068, titled "New Tc-99m
      Production Technologies and Tc-99m Generators", carried out under research
      contract No. 22460, "Optimization of a Mini-Plant for Automatic Production
      of Tc-99m Using a New Absorbent." presenting the preliminary results at
      the Iberoamerican congress of Chemsitry in 2018.
      <br />
      After a period working in industry as a chemical analyst, I got a
      scholarship from National Council for Scientific and Technological
      Development to study the master at University of São Paulo
      (<strong>USP</strong>) in Brazil, where I studied the conversion from
      1,2-Diphenylacetylene to (E)-1,2-Diphenylethene using a bidentate
      Ru(II)-NC catalyst" published in the
      <a
        href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.202200525"
        >European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry</a
      >
      under the supervision of the professor Dr. Haiduke, using Density
      Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM)
      to analyze each steps in the reaction. Studying a master degree in
      chemistry at USP, I had the opportunity to learn not only courses related
      to theoretical chemistry such as
      <a
        href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SQM5709"
        >Advance Quantum Chemistry</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SQM5836"
        >Principles of Density Functional Theory</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SQM5718"
        >Methods of Molecular Quantum Mechanics</a
      >
      or
      <a
        href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=QFL5605"
        >Statistical Mechanics</a
      >

      , but also courses related to theoretical physics, mathematics, and
      programming using recorded lesson from
      <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT</a>,
      <a href="https://www.ib.edu.ar/academicas/">Balseiro Institute</a>. <br />
      and other sources.
      <br />
      After finishing my master, I started my PhD in Germany, as a complementary
      tasks, I have participated in the Symposium of theoretical chemistry (STC
      2023 in Zürich), Workshop on Theoretical Chemistry 2024 in Bad Hofgastein,
      Turbomole: Today and Tomorrow (University of Oxford), hackathons in Berlin
      and Darmstadt. Besides, I supervised an summer intern, working on the
      project "Assessment of Novel Functionals for Optical Properties" funded by
      DAAD and
      <strong>Mitacs</strong> (Canada) and conducted some projects with master
      students in the Praktikum Computergestützte Berechnung von
      Molekülstrukturen lecture. During this period, I have studied some other
      courses such as "Mathematical Machine Learning" and "Introduction to
      Scientific Computing" in the Math department. Also I have been studying
      Quantum computing from recorded courses from
      <a href="https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/courses">IBM</a>.
      <br />
      Out of the academic world, I practice slackline, rugby, and hiking, having
      trekked the Alps in Austria, as well as explored Brazil and several cities
      in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I also practice hurling and have
      played in two hurling tournaments, in Eindhoven and Köln.
